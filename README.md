# Udacity_WeatherAndRestaurants
Udacity project part of Data Architect Nanodegree

This Udacity project use actual YELP and climate datasets in order to analyze the effects the weather has on customer reviews of restaurants. The data for temperature and precipitation observations are from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D) database. 

This also use a leading industry cloud-native data warehouse system called Snowflake for all aspects of the project. I then use the skills I have acquired in the preceding Designing Data Systems Course to architect and design a Data Warehouse DWH for the purpose of reporting and online analytical processing (OLAP).
